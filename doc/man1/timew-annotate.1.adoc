= timew-annotate(1)

== NAME
timew-annotate - add an annotation to intervals

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
*timew annotate* [_<id>_**...**] _<annotation>_**...**

== DESCRIPTION
The 'annotate' command is used to add an annotation to an interval.

Using the 'summary' command, and specifying the ':ids' hint shows interval IDs.
Using the right ID, you can identify an interval to annotate.

== EXAMPLES

For example, show the IDs:

[source]
----
$ timew summary :week :ids
----

Then having selected e.g. '@2' as the interval you wish to annotate:

[source]
----
$ timew annotate @2 'Lorem ipsum...'
Annotated @2 with "Lorem ipsum..."
----

Note that you can annotate multiple intervals with the same annotation:

[source]
----
$ timew annotate @2 @10 @23 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...'
Annotated @1 with "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..."
Annotated @10 with "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..."
Annotated @23 with "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..."
----

If there is active time tracking, you can omit the ID when you want to add annotations to the current open interval:

[source]
----
$ timew start foo
...
$ timew annotate bar
Annotated @1 with "bar"
----

This results in the current interval having annotations 'foo' and 'bar'.

== pass:[BUGS & LIMITATIONS]
The summary command truncates annotations longer than 15 characters.
To display longer annotations, one can use the export command, or a custom report.

Currently, the annotation command picks the last token from the command line and uses it as annotation.
I.e. using no quotes in an annotation command like

[source]
----
$ timew annotate @1 lorem ipsum dolor
----

will result in interval @1 having only 'dolor' as its annotation.
